# 🧠 Advanced AI – Probabilistic Reasoning

This repository contains an implementation of **probabilistic reasoning** for two domains:  
- 🏦 **Fraud Detection**  
- ❤️ **Heart Disease Diagnosis**  

using **Bayesian Networks (BNs)** and **Gaussian Processes (GPs)**.

It extends the Advanced AI module at the University of Lincoln by combining **discrete** and **continuous** probabilistic models to perform:
- Bayesian inference on complex datasets  
- Probabilistic reasoning with learned network structures  
- Comprehensive evaluation using modern metrics (AUC, ECL, KL Divergence, etc.)
